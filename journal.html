		I had not coded before, so I learned alot about the basics in CSS and HTML. I also learned about formatting and designing “div”s. I’ve begun to use github to publish my site, but it’s still a little confusing to use terminal to make commits. I’m currently working on my website’s homepage. It's inspired by a retro computer and has different files and applications you can click on to open new pages. I’m excited about continuing in this retro direction. It was a little frustrating trying to get the application images to link to new pages, but eventually I figured it out. In the next few weeks I want to try and make the site open windows like on a computer rather than pages.
