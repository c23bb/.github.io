			I built a code sketch, that counts from 1-100 in the console and reports "Fizz" for all multiples of 3, "Buzz" for all multiples of 5, and "Fizzbuzz" for all multiples of 15. <a href="fizzbuzz.html">Check it out here</a>

			So far in Java I've learned alot. A varible is a name that stores any value or data. A function is a set of steps with an input and output. So far we've focused taking an input and using the function to change it. To make a function actually run, you need to type "setInterval(<i>name of function</i>, <i>amount of time to delay the function in repeating</i>)". Some key words we've learned in javascript are: 
			<br>
			<br>
			"console.log" - Logs in console
			<br>
			"If Then Statement" - "if () {}" if what's in the () is true then whats in the {} happens
			<br>
			"Else If Then Statement" - "else if () {}"" if what's in the () is not true then whats in the {} happens

			I worked on building a landing page for my website using CSS animations, and gifs. I spent alot of time on it working to center things and make it all look nice. I'm very proud of the way it looks now!

			I worked with my brother, and he helped me clean up my files. I learned how to extract CSS/JS from HTML. This made my files alot cleaner, and simpler. I also started to think about my gift project. Looking foward toward next week!

			I had not coded before, so I learned alot about the basics in CSS and HTML. I also learned about formatting and designing “div”s. I’ve begun to use github to publish my site, but it’s still a little confusing to use terminal to make commits. I’m currently working on my website’s homepage. It's inspired by a retro computer and has different files and applications you can click on to open new pages. I’m excited about continuing in this retro direction. It was a little frustrating trying to get the application images to link to new pages, but eventually I figured it out. In the next few weeks I want to try and make the site open windows like on a computer rather than pages.
