	<h1>Week of 3/7/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I worked on the Javascript question sheets <a href="comp sci sheet.pdf" class="button"> <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Sheet </a>. I also gave my present to Nelson. He seemed to really like it. I also learned how to put in a download button. I have so many questions on how to make new things, like how to make your website responsive to screen size. I also want to learn best practices for making a website and how to structure the site proparly.
			
</p>

	<h1>Week of 2/28/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I worked on a project for Nelson. I got really into it and designing fun gifs. I took inspiration from <a href="https://thegeekdesigner.com/about/"> this </a>  website. I really liked the design and wanted to make something like it for a while. It took me a while to figure out how to design the gifs but eventually I figured out a super easy way! I also learned about html marquees, and include some javascript to make the loader page. I hope nelson likes it! You can view it  <a href="Nelson.html"> here </a>!

	<h1>Week of 2/21/22</h1>
		<p>
			I brainstormed some of my ideas for my next project. I spent most of my time desning the inspiration board, but also have thought up some super cool ideas <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__AybI2GaE0ZpT3laRqF8oGTm5wsR6nCcvvVbOaRd5k/edit?usp=sharing"> check it out </a>.

			I tweeked a few things on my data representation. You can view it <a href="Hotdog.html">here</a>. The calculator currently includes a Glizzy title, links to Amazon to buy hotdogs, shows how many hotdogs you ate this year, calculates the minutes off your life, has customized text based on the amount, and more. I showed it to my dad for Valentines Day and he thought it was very funny! I think he really enjoyed it.  


		<h1>Week of 2/7/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I finished my data representation. You can view it <a href="Hotdog.html">here</a>. I spent so much time over the weekend adding to the hot dog calculator. I didn't do most of my other homework which wasn't great, but I'm really proud of how it turned out. The calculator now shows a picture for each Glizzy title, links to Amazon to buy hotdogs, shows how many hotdogs you ate this year, calculates the minutes off your life, has customized text based on the amount, and more. I learned a ton building the calculator. I want to keep adding to it, and have so many ideas of other things to do to my site. I'm beggining to really enjoy coding and want to do more of it! There is so much I plan to do with my site now that I have more of an understanding. I plan  to correct my welcome page and create more animation focused projects!  

		<h1>Week of 1/31/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I contuined to work on my data representation. You can view it <a href="Hotdog.html">here</a>. Currently, I have it so that it turns the screen black and spits out a title based on the amount of hot dogs. It took me a while to get this working and I learned a lot! Some things I fixed is correctly using less than or greater than signs, and defining variables in the right place.

		<h1>Week of 1/24/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I contuined to work on my data representation. You can view it <a href="Hotdog.html">here</a>. I'm still unsure what is wrong with it, but I made some progress, and fixed some of the aesthetics. I also updated my github so now I can publish my website! 
		</p>


		<h1>Week of 1/10/22</h1>
		<p>
			This week I worked on building my data representation. The idea is it will show how many hotdogs you eat this year and how many minutes of your life that takes. You can view it <a href="Hotdog.html">here</a>. So far, I have the design where I like it, but I've been really struggling with the Javascript part. I'm not still unsure what is wrong with it. I also watched the videos posted on classes. Another slight problem is I just relized my website isn't updating. When I type the commands to push to Git Hub, there's some sort of error.

		<h1>Week of 12/6/21</h1>
		<p>
			This week I worked on building a gift for my dad for his birthday <a href="Dadbday1.html">(here)</a>. I took the intro part from other websites, but still had to figure out how to fit all the pieces togeather. It took me a bit of time to figure everything out, but it all came togeather in the end.
		</p>

		<h1>Week of 11/29/21</h1>
		<p>
			This week I worked on building a new project called Fancy A Fortune <a href="FancyAFortune.html">(here)</a>. I saw this on another website and really wanted to create my own. It puts a random fortune cookie on the screen when you press. Working on the project taught me a lot about Java and gave me a deeper understanding. I'm working on adding this to my homepage and other general improvments to my site! I'm still unsure what to do for my present

		<h1>Week of 11/22/21</h1>
		<p>
			Thanksgiving break there was no class.

		</p>

		<h1>Week of 11/15/21</h1>
		<p>
			I was sick and missed both classes this week.

		</p>


		<h1>Week of 11/8/21</h1>
		<p>
			I spent so much time trying to make windows work on my website. I currently need help implmenting them, but I have a code sketch <a href="tester.html">here</a>. The entire codesketch works, but I still can't figure out how to implement it with my home page. I scheduled a lab to go over it. In order to learn more about lightboxes I looked at a bunch of codesketches including <a href="https://codepen.io/imprakash/pen/GgNMXO">this</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp">this</a>.

			No journal because we had off for Diwali.

		</p>

		<h1>Week of 10/25/21</h1>
		<p>
			I built a code sketch, that counts from 1-100 in the console and reports "Fizz" for all multiples of 3, "Buzz" for all multiples of 5, and "Fizzbuzz" for for all multiples of 3 and 5. <a href="fizzbuzz.html">Check it out here</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			So far in Java I've learned alot. A varible is a name that stores any value or data. A function is a set of steps with an input and output. So far we've focused on taking an input and using the function to change it. To make a function actually run, you need to type "setInterval(<i>name of function</i>, <i>amount of time to delay the function in repeating</i>)". Some key words we've learned in javascript are: 
			<br>
			<br>
			"console.log" - Logs in console
			<br>
			"if () {}" (If Then Statement) -  if what's in the () is true then whats in the {} happens
			<br>
			"else if () {}" (Else If Then Statement) - "else if () {}" if what's in the () is not true then whats in the {} happens

			I worked on building a landing page for my website using CSS animations, and gifs. I spent alot of time on it working to center things and make it all look nice. I'm very proud of the way it looks now!
		</p>

		<h1>Week of 10/11/21</h1>
		<p>
			I worked with my brother, and he helped me clean up my files. I learned how to extract CSS/JS from HTML. This made my files alot cleaner, and simpler. I also started to think about my gift project. Looking foward toward next week!
		</p>

		<h1>Week of 10/4/21</h1>
		<p>
			I had not coded before, so I learned alot about the basics in CSS and HTML. I also learned about formatting and designing “div”s. I’ve begun to use github to publish my site, but it’s still a little confusing to use terminal to make commits. I’m currently working on my website’s homepage. It's inspired by a retro computer and has different files and applications you can click on to open new pages. I’m excited about continuing in this retro direction. It was a little frustrating trying to get the application images to link to new pages, but eventually I figured it out. In the next few weeks I want to try and make the site open windows like on a computer rather than pages.
