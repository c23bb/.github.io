		<h1>Week of 11/8/21</h1>
		<p>
			I spent so much time trying to make windows work on my website. I currently need help implmenting them, but I have a code sketch <a href="tester.html">here</a>. The entire codesketch works, but I still can't figure out how to implement it with my home page. I scheduled a lab to go over it. In order to learn more about lightboxes I looked at a bunch of codesketches including <a href="https://codepen.io/imprakash/pen/GgNMXO">this</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp">this</a>.

			No journal because we had off for Diwali.

		<h1>Week of 10/25/21</h1>

			I built a code sketch, that counts from 1-100 in the console and reports "Fizz" for all multiples of 3, "Buzz" for all multiples of 5, and "Fizzbuzz" for for all multiples of 3 and 5. <a href="fizzbuzz.html">Check it out here</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			So far in Java I've learned alot. A varible is a name that stores any value or data. A function is a set of steps with an input and output. So far we've focused on taking an input and using the function to change it. To make a function actually run, you need to type "setInterval(<i>name of function</i>, <i>amount of time to delay the function in repeating</i>)". Some key words we've learned in javascript are: 
			<br>
			<br>
			"console.log" - Logs in console
			<br>
			"if () {}" (If Then Statement) -  if what's in the () is true then whats in the {} happens
			<br>
			"else if () {}" (Else If Then Statement) - "else if () {}" if what's in the () is not true then whats in the {} happens

			I worked on building a landing page for my website using CSS animations, and gifs. I spent alot of time on it working to center things and make it all look nice. I'm very proud of the way it looks now!

		<h1>Week of 10/11/21</h1>
		<p>
			I worked with my brother, and he helped me clean up my files. I learned how to extract CSS/JS from HTML. This made my files alot cleaner, and simpler. I also started to think about my gift project. Looking foward toward next week!

		<h1>Week of 10/4/21</h1>
		<p>
			I had not coded before, so I learned alot about the basics in CSS and HTML. I also learned about formatting and designing “div”s. I’ve begun to use github to publish my site, but it’s still a little confusing to use terminal to make commits. I’m currently working on my website’s homepage. It's inspired by a retro computer and has different files and applications you can click on to open new pages. I’m excited about continuing in this retro direction. It was a little frustrating trying to get the application images to link to new pages, but eventually I figured it out. In the next few weeks I want to try and make the site open windows like on a computer rather than pages.
